    "raw_text": "The philosophers of ancient Greece wondered about the composition of matters: is\nmatter continuously divisible into ever smaller and smaller pieces, or is there an\nultimate limit? Although most philosophers, including Plato and Aristotle, believed\nthat matter is continuous, Democritus disagreed.",

    "raw_text": "One of the first experiments on subatomic particles was carried out by the English\nphysicist J.J. Thomson in 1897. Figure 1.1 shows an experimental apparatus similar\nto the one used by Thomson. In this apparatus, two electrodes from a high-voltage\nsource are sealed into a glass tube from which the air has been evacuated. The negative\nelectrode is called the cathode; the positive one, the anode. When the high-voltage\ncurrent is turned on, the glass tube emits a greenish light. Experiments showed that\nthis greenish light is caused by the interaction of the glass with cathode rays, which\nare rays that originate from the cathode.",

    "raw_text": "After the cathode rays leave the negative electrode, they move toward the anode,\nwhere some rays pass through a hole to form a beam (Figure 1.1). This beam bends\naway from the negatively charged plate and toward the positively charged plate.\nWhat did Thomson conclude from this observation? Figure 1.2 shows a similar\nexperiment, in which cathode rays are seen to bend when a magnet is brought toward\nthem. Thomson showed that the characteristics of cathode rays are independent of the\nmaterial making up the cathode. From such evidence, he concluded that a cathode ray\nconsists of a beam of negatively charged particles (or electrons) and that electrons are\nconstituents of all matter.",
